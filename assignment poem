<h1>Cinderella</h1>
<P> 

If my name was<strong> Cinderella</strong>
You could be the prince.
I could wear my sparkling prom dress.
We could fall in love the moment our eyes meet.
If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong>

If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong>
We could have a song.
And dance in the silver moonlight.
You could hold me tight and spin me in the air.
If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong>

If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong>
You could pick me up.
In your gold and diamond carriage.
You could be the hero of this fairytale.
And I could be the one.
If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong>

But I can't breathe, whenever you're with me.
Can you feel my heartbeat in my chest?
It's getting faster every second.
Time slows down, you are better than the best.
But would you feel the same.
If my name was<strong> Cinderella</strong>

I can't breathe.
â€˜Cause I'm not <strong>Cinderella</strong>
Until you're here with me.
I'm not <strong>Cinderella</strong>
You touch my lips.
I'm not <strong>Cinderella</strong>
Then you show me with a kiss.
That I'm your <strong>Cinderella</strong>
