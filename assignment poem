<h1>Cinderella</h1>
<P> 

<br>If my name was<strong> Cinderella</strong></br>
<br>You could be the prince.</br>
<br>I could wear my sparkling prom dress.</br>
<br>We could fall in love the moment our eyes meet.</br>
<br>If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>

<br>If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>
<br>We could have a song.</br>
<br>And dance in the silver moonlight.</br>
<br>You could hold me tight and spin me in the air.</br>
<br>If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>

<br>If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>
<br>You could pick me up.</br>
<br>In your gold and diamond carriage.</br>
<br>You could be the hero of this fairytale.</b>
<br>And I could be the one.</br>
<br>If my name was <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>

<br>But I can't breathe, whenever you're with me.</br>
<br>Can you feel my heartbeat in my chest?</br>
<br>It's getting faster every second.</br>
<br>Time slows down, you are better than the best.</br>
<br>But would you feel the same.</br>
<br>If my name was<strong> Cinderella</strong></br>

<br>I can't breathe.</br>
<br>â€˜Cause I'm not <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>
<br>Until you're here with me.</br>
<br>I'm not <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>
<br>You touch my lips.</br>
<br>I'm not <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>
<br>Then you show me with a kiss.</br>
<br>That I'm your <strong>Cinderella</strong></br>
